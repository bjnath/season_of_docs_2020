# The Good Docs Project

You hate writing it. And reading it.

Our goal (our only goal) is to help developers get on track with
documentation.

We have ideas on:

  * What you need to say
  * And where
  * And how much -- from Minimum Viable Documentation up to Unabridged
  * How to get help
  * surely more bullets..

Why draw if you can just color? The Good Docs Project is the Big Coloring Book of Documentation.
Open it to find fill-in-the-blanks templates for tutorials, how-tos, and other kinds of documentation,
preformatted in Markdown and RestructuredText


## Why this site

9,999 (real figure?) teams asked for help when Google first offered to pair open-source
projects with technical writers [[1]](#season_fn). Though great work got
done, we recalled the proverb about giving a person a fish versus teaching
them fishing [[2]](#fish_fn).  We
resolved to build this site to help developers help themselves. There's never enough hours
to write it all up -- Seasons of Docs will always be valuable -- but
you will better understand your requirements, and the docs you do do write will
be sound.

## Four things called documentation

Divide-and-conquer applies also to docs. Documentation has four goals,
resulting in four classes of document, each with its own writing formula: 
* tutorial
* how-to guide
* technical reference
* explanation

This is the stunning insight of [Daniele Procida](https://documentation.divio.com).
Attacking each goal with its formula in mind makes the job easier. (And your docs will be
better organized, and readers will have an easier time finding what they need.)

him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
