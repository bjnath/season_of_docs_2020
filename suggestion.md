# The Good Docs Project

You hate writing it. And reading it.

Our goal (our only goal) is to help developers get on track with
documentation.

We have ideas on:

  * What you need to say
  * And where
  * And how much -- from Minimum Viable Documentation up to Unabridged
  * How to get help
  * surely more bullets..

Seeing is believing, so we include an annotated example of what we'd call a
good doc job, which you can compare to its original version.


## Why this site

9,999 teams asked for help when Google first offered to pair open-source
projects with technical writers [1]. Though great work got
done, we recalled the proverb about giving a person a fish versus teaching
them fishing [2].  We
resolved to build this site to help developers help themselves. A team may not
have the time to write everything -- Seasons of Docs will always be valuable -- but
they will understand their requirements, and the docs they do have will
be sound.

[1] 2019 Season of Docs; several of us participated. We look forward to rejoining as [the 2020 Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) gets underway.<br>

him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
