# The Good Docs Project

You hate writing it. And reading it.

Our goal (our only goal) is to help developers get on track with
documentation.

We have ideas on:

  * What you need to say
  * And where
  * And how much -- from Minimum Viable Documentation up to Unabridged

The Good Docs Project is the Big Coloring Book of Documentation.
Open it to find fill-in-the-blanks templates for tutorials, how-tos, and other kinds of documentation,
preformatted in Markdown and RestructuredText


## Why this project

9,999 (real figure?) teams asked for help when Google first offered to pair open-source
projects with technical writers [[1]](#season_fn). Though great work got
done, we recalled the proverb about giving a person a fish versus teaching
them fishing [[2]](#fish_fn).  We
resolved to build this site to help developers help themselves. There's never enough hours
to write it all up -- Seasons of Docs will always be valuable -- but
you will better understand your requirements, and the docs you do do write will
be sound.


<a name="season_fn"></a>[1] 2019 Season of Docs; several of us participated. We look forward to rejoining as [the 2020 Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) gets underway.<br>

him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
