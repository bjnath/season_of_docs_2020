You don't hear the word "inspiration" in technical writing

I can understand a design differently than a person who sees it through glass.


Even as a technical writer, I get to write from inspiration


Sunsets inspire poets. As a writer who is an engineer, engineering inspires me, because I'm an engineer

I'm an engineer who writes; engineering inspires me more than dawns or sunsets

I fall in love with the design and write from the heart

Complexity is engineering's crabgrass

I'm able to pick up the design and turn it around


I can understand a design differently than a person who sees it through glass, because I've designed and debugged and struggled with complexity.
I feel the beauty of a design differently than

Designs are more to me than labeled boxes.



About me

When you describe a design to me, it won't be foreign geography; when I write
it, I won't be struggling to remember whether Zanzibar is in east or west
Africa.

I'm an engineer. Your work will excite me as much as it excites you.

And I write technical documentation. Often it's like writing stories, and a project has
many: Why it was done. Why it works the way it works. How you go about using
it. How you go about changing it.

See samples of my technical documentation and a bio at https://docs2020.bennathanson.com.

I will be as excited as you
which is why I'm participating in Season of Docs as a technical writer.

, and as a result the drawing on the page will come off the page and be real.
