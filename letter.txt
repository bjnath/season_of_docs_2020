When you describe a design to me, it won't be foreign geography; when I write
it, I won't be struggling to remember whether Zanzibar is in east or west
Africa.

I'm an engineer. Your work will excite me as much as it excites you.

And I write technical documentation. To you, your project isn't boxes on a page
and characters on a screen, but stories: Why it was done. Why it works the way
it works. How you go about using it. How you go about changing it. All that's
missing is words.

-- boxes on a page, characters on a screen --


I will be as excited as you
which is why I'm participating in Season of Docs as a technical writer.

, and as a result the drawing on the page will come off the page and be real.
