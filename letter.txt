When you describe a design to me, it won't be foreign geography; when I write
it, I won't be struggling to remember whether Zanzibar is in east or west
Africa.

I'm an engineer. Your work will excite me as much as it excites you.

And I write technical documentation. To you the code isn't glyphs on a screen,
it's stories: Why you started it. Why it works the way it does. How to use it.
How to fix it and add to it. Words are all that's missing.

You can see samples of my technical documentation and a bio at
https://docs2020.bennathanson.com.








-- boxes on a page, characters on a screen --


I will be as excited as you
which is why I'm participating in Season of Docs as a technical writer.

, and as a result the drawing on the page will come off the page and be real.
