Words and numbers
=================

When you describe a design to me, it won't be foreign geography; when I write
it, I won't be struggling to remember whether Zanzibar is in east or west
Africa.

I'm an engineer. Your work will excite me as much as it excites you.

And I write technical documentation. To you the code isn't glyphs on a screen,
it's stories: Why you started it. Why it works the way it does. How to use it.
How to fix it and add to it. Words are all that's missing.
